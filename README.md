  <h1>Bolt</h1>
</div>

Bolt is a command-line tool designed to simplify and streamline your database migration process.

üåü Key Features:
- **SQL-Powered Flexibility**: üß© - Write your migration scripts in plain SQL. This gives you the full power and familiarity of SQL, ensuring that you're not limited by the constraints of a specific DSL (Domain Specific Language).

- **Bidirectional Migrations**: üîÄ - With support for both 'up' (migrating) and 'down' (downgrading) migrations, Bolt provides complete control over your database versions. This feature is essential for maintaining database integrity and for executing seamless rollbacks whenever necessary.

- **Time-Travel with Ease**: ‚è≥ - Migrate or downgrade to any specific point in time. Bolt allows you to specify a specific migration version to migrate or downgrade to, allowing you to easily time-travel to any point in your database's history.

- **Safe and Reliable**: üõ°Ô∏è - Built with safety and reliability in mind, Bolt ensures your migrations are executed smoothly, with clear logging and error handling.

## Installation

To install Bolt, run the following command:

```bash
$ go install github.com/eugenetriguba/bolt@latest
```

This will install Bolt to your `$GOBIN` directory. Make sure that `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the basics of using Bolt by running through how you can create a migration, apply it, revert it, and see the status of your migrations.

### Creating your first migration

Run the following command to create your first migration:

```bash
$ bolt new -m "my first migration"
```

Upon completion, a migrations directory will be created with the following structure:

```bash
migrations/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20240113162817_my_first_migration
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ downgrade.sql
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ upgrade.sql

1 directories, 2 files
```

Bolt automatically creates the migrations directory and your migration scripts inside it.

### Writing your migration scripts

Bolt utilizes plain SQL for migration scripts. Each migration directory contains `upgrade.sql` for applying migrations and `downgrade.sql` for reverting them.

1. Write the Upgrade Script

Edit `upgrade.sql` with the following SQL command to create a new table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

2. Write the Downgrade Script

Edit `downgrade.sql` with the following SQL command to remove the table:

```sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

### Starting up a Database Container

We'll use Docker to run a PostgreSQL database container for this tutorial:

1. Install Docker

If you don't have docker installed, view the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

2. Startup the PostgreSQL container

```bash
$ docker run --name bolt-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=bolt_user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bolt_password -e POSTGRES_DB=bolt_tutorial_db -p 5432:5432 --detach postgres:16.1-alpine3.19
```

### Configuring Bolt

Bolt can be configured with a `bolt.toml` file or environment variables. For simplicity, we'll use a `bolt.toml` file in this tutorial.

1. Create a `bolt.toml` file:

```bash
$ touch bolt.toml
```

2. Add the following contents to the file:

```toml
[connection]
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
user = "bolt_user"
password = "bolt_password"
dbname = "bolt_tutorial_db"
driver = "postgres"
```

### Applying your migration

Apply your migration, which will execute the `upgrade.sql` script:

```bash
$ bolt up
Applying migration 20240113162817_my_first_migration..
Successfully applied migration 20240113162817_my_first_migration!
```

### Checking Migration Status

To view the status of your migration:

```bash
$ bolt status
Version           Message               Applied
20240113162817    my_first_migration    X
```

This command displays the migration's version, name, and whether the migration was applied or not.

### Verifying the Migration

Connect to the database container to confirm the users table was created:

```bash
$ docker exec -it bolt-postgres psql -U bolt_user -d bolt_tutorial_db
```

```psql
bolt_tutorial_db=# \dt
              List of relations
 Schema |      Name       | Type  |   Owner
--------+-----------------+-------+-----------
 public | bolt_migrations | table | bolt_user
 public | users           | table | bolt_user
(2 rows)
```

We can see that our `users` table was created successfully. We also see another table that we didn't explicitly create called `bolt_migrations`. This table is used by Bolt to keep track of which migrations have been applied to your database. You should not modify this table manually.

### Downgrading Your Migration

To revert your migration:

```bash
$ bolt down
Reverting migration 20240113162817_my_first_migration..
Successfully reverted migration 20240113162817_my_first_migration!
```

### Verifying Migration Reversion

Reconnect to the database container and check that the users table has been removed:

```bash
$ docker exec -it bolt-postgres psql -U bolt_user -d bolt_tutorial_db
```

```psql
bolt_tutorial_db=# \dt
              List of relations
 Schema |      Name       | Type  |   Owner
--------+-----------------+-------+-----------
 public | bolt_migrations | table | bolt_user
(1 row)
```

### Next Steps

Congrats! You've learned the core features of Bolt. If you want learn more, see the [Reference](#reference) or [Explanation](#explanation) section.

## Reference

### Database Compatibility

At the moment, only PostgreSQL is supported. You're welcome to contribute support for other databases.

### Configuration

There are two ways to configure Bolt: via a `bolt.toml` file or via environment variables. If you use both methods, the environment variables will take precedence.

#### Configuration File

Bolt attempts to find a `bolt.toml` file in your current working directory
or in any parent directory.

```toml
# The directory where your migration scripts are located.
# Defaults to "migrations". This directory is relative to
# the current working directory. You may also use an absolute
# path.
migrations_dir = "migrations"

# Connection parameters for the database Bolt will be
# applying migrations to. All connection parameters are
# required.
[connection]
# The host to use to connect to your database.
host = 
# The port to use to connect to your database.
# Note: This should be an integer.
port = 
# The user to use to connect to your database.
user = 
# The password to use to connect to your database.
password = 
# The name of the database within your DBMS.
dbname = 
# The name of the database driver to use to connect to
# the database. At the moment, only "postgres" is supported.
driver = 
```

#### Environment Variables

All configuration file settings have corresponding environment variables.

- `BOLT_MIGRATIONS_DIR`
- `BOLT_CONNECTION_HOST`
- `BOLT_CONNECTION_PORT`
- `BOLT_CONNECTION_USER`
- `BOLT_CONNECTION_PASSWORD`
- `BOLT_CONNECTION_DBNAME`
- `BOLT_CONNECTION_DRIVER`

## Explanation

### How Are Migration Scripts Executed?

Bolt executes upgrade and downgrade migration scripts in a transaction. This ensures that if any errors occur during the execution of any migration script, the transaction will be rolled back and the migration will be marked as failed. Bolt will then exit with an error code and output what error has occurred to standard error.

### How Does Bolt Know What Migrations Have Been Applied?

Bolt keeps track of which migrations have been applied to your database by creating a table called `bolt_migrations`. This table contains a single column called `version` which is the version of the migration that was applied. That version is compared to the versions you have locally.

### How Are Migrations Applied?

When you run `bolt up`, Bolt will look at your local migration scripts and compares the version part of the migration directory names to the versions that have been inserted into the `bolt_migrations` table. Any versions that aren't in the table will be applied in order, starting with the oldest migration.

### How Are Migrations Reverted?

When you run `bolt down`, Bolt will look at the `bolt_migrations` table and compare the versions to the versions of your local migration scripts. Any versions that are in the table but not in your local migration scripts will be reverted in order, starting with the newest migration.
